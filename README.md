# Hi there! 👋

### About me:
I'm a second-year computer science student at the University of California&mdash;Santa Barbara. Originally, I'm from Burlington, Washington.  

I will graduate in the Spring of 2025 (as a junior). I will attend a Masters' program to further continue my computer science education and deeping my understanding for my interests. Location: *unknown*.

<!--
### Currently:
🔭 Working as an intern at *Haggard Labs / Burgher Haggard* developing a financial aggregation app.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I'm building a personal website and an AI game (more details soon!).  
🌱 Learning about computation theory and quantum computing. Woohoo!   
🤔 Interested in computability (both quantum and classical), cryptography, and digital finance.   
❤️‍🔥 My favorite languages are TypeScript, C++, and Python. I'm a big fan of Rust, but I don't use it as much as I'd like.
